# HID Keyboard (OTP)

The OTP interface presents itself to the operating system as a USB keyboard.
The OTP application is accessible over this interface. None of the other
applications are available through the OTP interface.

Output is sent as a series of keystrokes from a virtual keyboard. This allows
for OTP to be used in any environment which can accept standard keyboard input.

## The keyboard interface

### Reading status

### Sending a request
